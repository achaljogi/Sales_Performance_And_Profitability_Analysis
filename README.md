End-to-end Data Analytics project analyzing sales performance and profitability using Python, SQL, and visualization techniques. Focused on identifying revenue trends, profit drivers, and loss-making segments to support business decision-making.

# Sales Performance and Profitability Analysis

## Project Overview
The project analyzes retail sales data to understand sales trends, profitability, and business performance by using python(pandas) for data cleaning, created dataframes by using pandas. Used matplotlib for visualization.
## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- visual studio code (did project here)

## Objectives
- Analyze sales and profit trends
- Identify top-performing categories
- Detect loss-making segments
- Generate business insights

## Project Structure
data/        -> dataset reference
notebooks/   -> analysis notebooks

### Profitability Analysis
- Analyzed profit distribution across categories and sub-categories
- Identified loss-making products and regions
- Highlighted mismatch between high sales and low profitability

### Discount Impact Analysis
- Analyzed profit sensitivity to discount levels
- Identified over-discounted and loss-making sub-categories
- Provided data-driven recommendations for pricing strategy

## Time Series Analysis
- Analyzed monthly sales and profit trends using order date
- Applied resampling techniques to identify seasonality and growth patterns
- Prepared visual insights for business decision-making

## Category Performance Analysis
- Evaluated sales and profit across product categories and sub-categories
- Identified high-revenue and low-profit segments
- Highlighted areas for potential cost optimization

## Regional Performance Analysis

- Identified top-performing and underperforming regions
- Provided insights to support region-wise business strategy

## Customer Segment Analysis
- Analyzed sales and profit across customer segments
- Identified the most profitable customer segment
- Provided insights to optimize customer targeting strategies

## Status
- Downloaded Data from Kaggle
